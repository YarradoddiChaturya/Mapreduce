before the cat moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been
watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d
have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The
cat’
s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet
Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the
silver of his hair and beard, which were both long

enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long
robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and
high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles
and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it
had been broken at least twice. This man’
s name was
Albus Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’
t seem to realize that he had
just arrived in a street where everything from his
name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy

rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But
he did seem to realize he was being watched, because
he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still
staring at him from the other end of the street. For
some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse
him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have
known.”
He found what he was looking for in his inside
pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter
. He
flicked it open, held it up in the air
, and clicked it.
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He
clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into
darkness. T
welve times he clicked the Put-Outer
,
until the only lights left on the whole street were two
tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of
the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their
window now
, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley
, they
wouldn’
t be able to see anything that was happening
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-
Outer back inside his cloak and set of
f down the

street toward number four
, where he sat down on the
wall next to the cat. He didn’
t look at it, but after a
moment he spoke to it.
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”

He turned to smile at the tabby
, but it had gone.
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the
shape of the markings the cat had had around its
eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She
looked distinctly ruf
fled.
“How did you know it was me?” she asked.
“My dear Professor
, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stif
fly
.”
“Y
ou’d be stif
f if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all
day
,” said Professor McGonagall.
“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I
must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my
way here.”

Professor McGonagall snif
fed angrily
.
“Oh yes, everyone’
s celebrating, all right,” she said
impatiently
. “Y
ou’d think they’d be a bit more careful,
but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’
s
going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head
back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window
. “I
heard it. Flocks of owls … shooting stars. … W
ell,
they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to
notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll
bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much
sense.”
“Y
ou can’
t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently
.
“W
e’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven
years.”
“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably
.
“But that’
s no reason to lose our heads. People are
being downright careless, out on the streets in broad

swapping rumors.”
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore
here, as though hoping he was going to tell her
something, but he didn’
t, so she went on. “A fine
thing it would be if, on the very day Y
ou-Know-Who
seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found
out about us all. I suppose he really 
has
 gone,
Dumbledore?”
“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “W
e have
much to be thankful for
. W
ould you care for a lemon
drop?”
“A 
what
?”
“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m
rather fond of.”
“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly
, as
though she didn’
t think this was the moment for
lemon drops. “As I say
, even if Y
ou-Know-Who 
has
gone —”
“My dear Professor
, surely a sensible person like
yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘Y
ou-
www.ztcprep.com

Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been
trying to persuade people to call him by his proper
name: 
V
oldemort. 
” Professor McGonagall flinched, but
Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,
seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we
keep saying ‘Y
ou-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any
reason to be frightened of saying V
oldemort’
s name.”
“I know you haven’
t,” said Professor McGonagall,
sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re
dif
ferent. Everyone knows you’re the only one Y
ou-
Know- oh, all right, 
V
oldemort, 
was frightened of.”
P a g e

“Y
ou flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly
. “V
oldemort had powers I will
never have.”
“Only because you’re too — well — 
noble
 to use
them.”
“It’
s lucky it’
s dark. I haven’
t blushed so much since
Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuf
fs.”
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at
Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to
www.ztcprep.com

the 
rumors
 that are flying around. Y
ou know what
everyone’
s saying? About why he’
s disappeared?
About what finally stopped him?”
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real
reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all
day
, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she
fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she
did now
. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was
saying, she was not going to believe it until
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore,
however
, was choosing another lemon drop and did
not answer
.
“What they’re 
saying, 
” she pressed on, “is that last
night V
oldemort turned up in Godric’
s Hollow
. He
went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and
James Potter are — are — that they’re — 
dead. 
”
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall
gasped.
“Lily and James … I can’
t believe it … I didn’
t want to
www.ztcprep.com

believe it … Oh, Albus …”
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the
shoulder
. “I know … I know …” he said heavily
.
P a g e

Professor McGonagall’
s voice trembled as she went
on. “That’
s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the
Potters’ son, Harry
. But — he couldn’
t. He couldn’
t
kill that little boy
. No one knows why
, or how
, but
they’re saying that when he couldn’
t kill Harry Potter
,
V
oldemort’
s power somehow broke — and that’
s why
he’
s gone.”
Dumbledore nodded glumly
.
“It’
s — it’
s 
true
?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After
all he’
s done … all the people he’
s killed … he couldn’
t
kill a little boy? It’
s just astounding … of all the
things to stop him … but how in the name of heaven
did Harry survive?”
“W
e can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “W
e may
never know
.”

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.
Dumbledore gave a great snif
f as he took a golden
watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very
odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers;
instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It
must have made sense to Dumbledore, though,
because he put it back in his pocket and said,
“Hagrid’
s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be
here, by the way?”
“Y
es,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’
t
suppose you’re going to tell me 
why
 you’re here, of all
places?”
“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.
They’re the only family he has left now
.”
“Y
ou don’
t mean — you 
can’
t
 mean the people who

feet and pointing at number four
. “Dumbledore — you can’

t

find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got
this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way
up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter
come and live here!”
“It’
s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly
.
“His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything
to him when he’
s older
. I’ve written them a letter
.”
“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly
,
sitting back down on the wall. “Really
, Dumbledore,
you think you can explain all this in a letter? These
people will never understand him! He’ll be famous —
a legend — I wouldn’
t be surprised if today was
known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will
be books written about Harry — every child in our
world will know his name!”
“Exactly
,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously
over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be
enough to turn any boy’
s head. Famous before he can
walk and talk! Famous for something he won’
t even
remember! Can’
t you see how much better of
